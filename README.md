# Inventory-Management-System
This command-line Python project allows users to manage inventory with CRUD functionality. Users can add items (part number, price, description, stock), view the list of items, update item details, delete items, and search for specific entries. Duplicate part numbers are automatically assigned a new one. Simple and easy to use.
