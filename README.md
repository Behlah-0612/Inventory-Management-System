# Inventory-Management-System
This project is a simple command-line-based Inventory Management System, developed using Python. It is designed to be easy to understand and use, making it an ideal project for beginners or those who want to learn about building basic CRUD operations in Python. The system includes the fundamental functions needed for inventory management, such as adding, viewing, updating, deleting, and searching for items.

Key Features:

 Add Inventory Items:

  When adding a new inventory item, the user is prompted to enter the part number, price, description, and stock.
  
If the part number entered by the user already exists in the system, the program automatically assigns the next available part number to avoid conflicts.

 View Inventory Items:

  The system displays all the items in the inventory in a clean list view, showing the part number, price, description, and stock. This allows users to easily track and manage their inventory.
  
 Update Inventory Items:

  Users can easily update any information about the inventory items, such as the part number, price, description, or stock, ensuring that records stay up to date.
  
 Delete Inventory Items:

  Items can be removed from the inventory with a simple command, allowing for easy management of obsolete or outdated stock.
  
 Search Inventory Items:

  The program includes a search feature that allows users to find specific inventory items by part number or description. This makes it easier to locate items within a large list.
This project focuses on the core operations of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD), making it a great learning tool. The command-based approach ensures that users can interact with the program directly in a terminal environment without any graphical user interface, keeping things simple yet functional.

Overall, this Inventory Management System is designed for basic inventory tasks and provides a straightforward way to manage and organize items.
